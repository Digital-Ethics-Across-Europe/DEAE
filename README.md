# DEAE
Digital Ethics Across Europe (DEAE) is an end-of-course project for the exam Open Access and Digital Ethics

We aim to analyze and repurpose open access datasets to highlight the significance of digital ethics in addressing LGBTQ+ disparities and to explore the variations in treatment across different European countries.
